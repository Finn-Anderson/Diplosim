		<p>When starting off, your first problem will be about your placement of your egg timer. The egg timer is the most important building. If it gets destroyed, you will lose the game. So it is important to place it both in a strategically defensive position that also has enough resources nearby.<br><br>

		When it comes to <a href="raid.html">raids</a>, there are two types to consider when placing your egg timer. Ones that come from rival factions through the portal when it is rebuilt and <a href="conquest.html">conquest</a> is enabled, and ones that spawn naturally. The ones that spawn naturally cannot be within 30 tiles of the egg timer, so this should give some leeway in where you want to place your egg timer.<br><br>

		Not only are defensive capabilities important, but also resource abundance. Whilst there are no restrictions to building distance from the egg timer, it does make it harder to defend buildings miles away from both <a href="raid.html">raids</a> and <a href="naturaldisasters.html">natural disasters</a>, and also increases the distance needed to travel (unless you build their home next to their work). So, it would be beneficial to place your egg timer around the most important resources, which is wood, stone and iron. However, be mindful that if you place a building on top of trees, they will be permanently removed.<br><br>

		After your choose your start location and place your egg timer, you will then need to place a builder's hut to build future buildings. The location of this builder's hut is not too important, just try to keep it close by and reachable by citizens.<br><br>

		Now that you know the importance of a starting location, you can now learn about <a href="management.html">Managing Your Colony</a>.</p>
