	<p>Managing your colony can be a daunting task. From learning about citizens needs to dealing with citizen personality clashes, it can be a lot. However, there are ways to manage this.<br><br>

	First off, food is a resource your citizens need. Making sure that you have enough food is essential to your colonies survival. Each food resource produces at a different rate and amount, along with the fertility of the ground if you are using <a href="nav/buildings/farm.html">farms</a> instead of <a href="nav/buildings/hydroponic.html">hydroponic farms</a>. It is recommended to start off with two hay farms on good fertile ground.<br><br>

	Once you have met your citizens food needs, it is now time to manage their happiness. If you click on a citizen and hover over their happiness, you can view what they are happy and sad about. At this stage of the game, they are probably most upset by a lack of housing and religious buildings. However, to be able to build these buildings, you may first need to build resource gatherers such as a <a href="nav/buildings/woodcutter.html">woodcutter</a> or a <a href="nav/buildings/miners.html">mine</a>.<br><br>

	Housing satisfaction can also affect the happiness of a citizen. Housing satisfaction is determined by the cost of rent relative to the base rent. So, higher rent means lower satisfaction, whilst vice versa means higher satisfaction. Early game buildings will have little variance, but later on in the game you can manage your buildings maintenance to maximise the satisfaction happiness.

	Paychecks and rent are always sorted on the 6th hour of the day and will be the main income of the colony, but not the only way to make money. A <a href="nav/buildings/production/coinmint.html">coin mint</a> or a <a href="nav/buildings/services/trader.html">trader</a> can be also be used to make more money.

	After managing your citizens happiness and food needs, it's onto managing their personalities. Each citizen has two personalities, which may come into direct conflict with other citizens. If two citizens argue over something at work, a brawl may begin, causing them to potentially get injured. This affects their stats such as productivity and movement, and may end up killing the citizen if left untreated. You can stop this by happening by setting up a military presence nearby or by installing a <a href="nav/buildings/clinic.html">clinic</a>.<br><br>

	Personalities also go further, with some affecting the fertility, productivity, speed, damage, ideal work hours and ideal sleep hours. These will all affect happiness as well, so you will need to manage these over time and may need to set specific jobs to cater certain citizens.<br><br>

	If a citizen is unhappy at their job, they will look for another free job. Meanwhile, if a citizen is happy at their job, they are unlikely to go for a better job. A citizen's happiness at a job is directly affected by the personalities they are surrounded by. If they are surrounded by personalities that either match theirs or personalities they like, they are more likely to stay. The same applies vice versa.<br><br>

	A citizen's genetics can also affect your management of a colony. Citizen genetics can affect their fertility, productivity, speed, damage, health, reach, awareness, sustenance, hunger and energy. These traits will all independently affect the game in numerous ways, such as reach, damage and health affecting the ability of a citizen to defend their colony from invaders. You can view whether a citizen has bad, normal or good genetics by clicking on a citizen.<br><br>

	Finally, if you feel like a citizen is becoming a menance to the colony and you have enough <a href="nav/resources/crystal.html">crystals</a>, you can click on a citizen and smite them from your colony.<br><br>

	There is more to managing your citizens through the extensive political system explored on the <a href="politics.html">politics</a> page.</p>
