		<p>There are two types of raids in this game.<br><br>

		The first type of raid scales based on the resources mined. So for every 200 stone, you get one stone wisp. They don't vary in ability other than just colour. This raid can spawn anywhere on the map except within 30 tiles from the egg timer.<br><br>

		The other type of raid is from a warring faction through <a href="conquest.html">conquest</a>. This raid can happene at any time, however, the AI tends to only do it when they have an numbers advantage over the warring faction.<br><br>

		The player can create their own army to raid/conquer another warring faction by clicking on the plus button in the bottom left and selecting which citizens to enlist to the army. However beware as these citizens will still be paid by their current employment and not work until the army is disbanded.

		If you would like a further analysis of how the conquest and diplomacy system works, please continue to <a href="conquest.html">Diplomacy</a>.</p>
