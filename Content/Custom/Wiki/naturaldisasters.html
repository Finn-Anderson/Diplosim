	<p>Natural disasters are a randomly generated event that can happen at any time. It is also possible multiple natural disasters can happen at one time, however, this chance is very low. The magnitude of the natural disasters along with the frequency of them can be altered at the start of the game before the egg timer is placed.<br><br>
