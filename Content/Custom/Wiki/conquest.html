		<p>Every AI will be given a faction and manage a separarte colony. These colonies can range from being set to at least 30 tiles to the player to on a different island depending on the map generation.<br><br>

		To navigate towards other AI factions on separate islands, <a href="nav/buildings/portal.html">portals</a> can be used to go between islands. Portals are not tied to each other, meaning any portal can go to any other protal, and can also be placed anywhere that is not close to another faction.<br><br>

		The player can choose to be a conqueror through the <a href="raids.html">army system</a>, although can dynamically also choose to ally and be peaceful through diplomacy. The diplomacy tab, accessible in the bottom right of the hotbar next to the speed buttons, can be used to broker alliances, gift goods to appease, or alternatively be used to declare war against other factions. All of this is also possible by the AI, however, this is linked to their happiness level with another faction, which is altered by numerous factors such as culture (dominant religion & ruling party), allied with enemies/allies, warring with enemies/allies, recently been at war/allies, and optional options such as whether a faction praised/insulted them or the value of their gift(s).<br><br>

		The next and final part of this tutorial will go over <a href="naturaldisasters.html">Natural Disasters</a>.</p>
