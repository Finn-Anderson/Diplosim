CORS header has cock-blocked me from doing cool things. 1st I tried using XMLHttpRequest: NO. Then I tried using fetch: NO. Finally I tried an iframe with custom css: NO.

This single grubby policy can only be sorted in one way: spending money on a server or spending money on electricity to run a server. I am not doing that.

I also do not want to use up space downloading frameworks to show the wiki page.

So I'm left to do it the manual way. No automation for me! HAHA!






Note: Just in case someone finds this and people start telling me why CORS exists, I understand why it exists. I am just a little upset I couldn't do what I wanted to.
