	<p>The political system can be accessed after building <a href="nav/buildings/parliament.html">parliament</a>. After parliament is built, an election will happen and will elect random members based on the number of members in the party. Citizens join these parties based on which parties resemble their personality the best.<br><br>

	You can propose new laws through the council menu. Certain laws vibrate better with different parties, so you may find it hard to propose certain laws you want. You can combat this by either bribing members of parliament during law proposition phase, or by building <a href="nav/buildings/radiotower.html">radio towers</a> and promoting a party that agrees with the law you want.<br><br>

	After picking a law to propose, it will take a full day before you can alter this law again. So be careful about which laws you want to enact.<br><br>

	You will also need to monitor your citizens' happiness, as proposing too many opposing laws will upset citizens that are not feeling represented in parliament.<br><br>
