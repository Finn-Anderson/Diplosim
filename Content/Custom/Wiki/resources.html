	<p>Resource can be split into two categories: vegetation and minerals.<br><br>

	Minerals are resource that require a <a href="nav/buildings/production/miners.html">miner</a> to be built on to harvest the resource. These resources are infinite and will never run out. Resources that are minerals include stone, marble, gold, and iron.<br><br>

	vegetation on the other hand is not the same kinda of infinite. It will regrow over time in the same spot when chopped (trees), unless it is either built over or is dead at the start of the game (this is visually shown without any leaves). Vegetation includes trees and flowers, however, only trees can be harvested.<br><br>

	The quantity of minerals and vegetation, along with the density of vegetation, can be altered via the map settings when generating a map to have your colony on.<br><br>

	Resources are an important aspect when it comes to your colony and starting off, but so is knowing how to <a href="management.html">manage your colony</a>.</p>
